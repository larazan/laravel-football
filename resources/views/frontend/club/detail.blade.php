                            Hlozek joined head coach Gerardo Seoane and his squad for the team&lsquo;s training camp in Austria in July. Florian Wirtz also made the trip to continue his rehabilitation after his cruciate ligament injury in March.

                        <p>
                            Alongside training sessions, media appointments and time with travelling fans, there were also two friendly matches. The game against Greek Cup holders Panathinaikos - where Hlozek made his debut - ended goalless. An encounter with Udinese of Italy resulted in a 2-1 win.

                            However, they’re prone to illness and infestations when
                            improperly watered.

                        <p>
                            As overwatering is perhaps the single biggest mistake plant
                            lovers make regularly, it’s essential to know the signs of
                            overwatering, address them, and what to do in severe cases.

                        <h2>6 Signs Of Overwatered Peace Lily</h2>
                        <p>
                            The following symptoms don’t always equate to overwatering
                            but are a good indicator. Try to eliminate other possible
                            causes of these signs and follow the remedies we’ve included
                            to solve each symptom.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Soggy Soil</h3>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the single most obvious sign of overwatering is the
                            soil itself. You should never see puddles forming, nor
                            should the soil feel squishy to the touch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, many factors affect how much and how often
                            your plant will drink, so watering on a schedule is one of
                            the worst things you can do. The soak-and-dry method is
                            perhaps the most effective way to water plants, with few
                            exceptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Follow these steps:</p>
                        <ol className="list-disc">
                            <li>
                                Simply stick your finger in the soil to judge how far down
                                it feels dry.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Always water slowly, working your way around the pot and
                                doing your best not to get the leaves wet.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Stop watering when you see moisture seeping from the
                                drainage holes, or the surface can no longer absorb at the
                                same speed you’re pouring.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Yellowing Leaves</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the language of plants, this sign is the equivalent of a
                            human saying, “I don’t feel so well.” However, it’s not
                            difficult to verify this is being caused by overwatering by
                            checking the soil when you see yellowing leaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some other common causes of yellow leaves include the
                            following:
                        </p>

                        <ol className="list-disc">
                            <li>Sunburn</li>
                            <li>Infestations</li>
                            <li>Root rot</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Follow the soil care guide below once you confirm the
                            problem is being caused by overwatering. Chances are, many
                            of the leaves will regain their color, but some may be too
                            far gone and will need to be pruned away.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Blisters</h3>
                        <p>
                            When you spend too long in a tub or pool, your skin will
                            become so saturated that it wrinkles. Plants suffer a
                            similar condition called edema, in which the roots are
                            drawing more water than the plant can use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result, the excess water fills leaf cells until they
                            burst, causing blister-like abscesses that can be found
                            mainly on the undersides of the leaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is one of those conditions where you will likely need
                            to repot the plant. The blisters can eventually burst, and
                            you may find it necessary to prune away the worst leaves.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Brown Or Black Leaf Tips</h3>
                        <p>
                            Commonly associated with chemical burns from fertilizers or
                            sunburn, brown to black lea tips may also be related to
                            overwatering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, this damage cannot be reversed. Some
                            yellowing and black means that part of the plant has turned
                            necrotic. The only treatment for this symptom is to remove
                            the damaged leaves.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Fungus Gnats Or Oddly-Tinted Soil</h3>
                        <p>
                            Fungus gnats are tiny insects that serve as pollinators for
                            some plants but are largely pests. These little guys can be
                            a sign of overwatering, as the larvae feed on soil-based
                            fungi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Depending on the fungus, you might not be able to see it, or
                            you might see a greenish tint or gray to white cottony film
                            on the surface.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These problems can often be solved using a neem soil soak
                            and possibly also fungicide (although neem oil will kill
                            some forms of fungus).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Root Rot</h3>
                        <p>
                            Root rot is the worst-case scenario, and it can kill your
                            plant if left untreated. In addition to yellowed, droopy
                            leaves, you’ll likely smell a foul odor coming from the
                            soil. Either bacteria or fungus may cause root rot, so you
                            can’t rely on fungicides to treat it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You’ll have to dig up the plant, remove the damaged roots,
                            sterilize the surviving roots, and plant it in a fresh pot
                            with fresh soil to treat root rot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that neem soil soaks have been known to help fight off
                            both bacterial and fungal root rot in its early stages but
                            will not be able to save a plant once the condition begins
                            to worsen.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How To Treat Severe Overwatering?</h2>
                        <p>
                            In most of the above cases, you can stop watering to allow
                            the soil to dry out, but what happens when the damage is a
                            bit more severe, or the plant has been overwatered
                            repeatedly?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Treating severe overwatering means acting fast and
                            completely repotting the plant.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Step 1: Remove The Wet Soil</h3>
                        <p>
                            Tip the pot over and slide the plant out, gently removing as
                            much dirt from the roots as possible. Now is a good time to
                            check for root rot and treat it, if necessary. It’s often
                            good to let the plant dry out a little for 8 hours (or
                            overnight) in a warm, dry spot.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step 2: Prepare A New Container</h3>
                        <p>
                            If your old pot has adequate drainage holes, you can soak it
                            in a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water for 30
                            minutes and allow it to dry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Otherwise, you’ll want to get a new container, making sure
                            the drainage holes are large enough and that the pot isn’t
                            too big or small for your plant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To help ensure the best drainage, ad a ½ to 1” inch layer of
                            gravel or aquarium stones to the bottom of the pot.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step 3: Prepare The Soil</h3>
                        <p>Here are the steps to prepare the soil:</p>

                        <ol className="list-disc">
                            <li>
                                Now you’ll want to add some fresh soil to the container.
                                Don’t use the old soil, as it’s likely contaminated.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Mix some perlite or coarse sand into the soil to help
                                ensure it remains loose, as compacted soil can contribute
                                to overwatering issues.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add the soil to the container and give it a light
                                watering.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            You only need enough to get the soil slightly damp to help
                            things settle.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Step 4: Replant Your Peace Lily</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the pot and soil are ready, you can replant your lily.
                            Ensure it’s planted at the same depth as before and give it
                            another light watering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that the plant needs LESS water if you group it with
                            other plants, as over 97% percent of the water it absorbs is
                            used in transpiration (essentially sweating to improve local
                            humidity levels).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Grouped plants share the benefits of transpiration, reducing
                            the amount of water they need.
                        </p>
